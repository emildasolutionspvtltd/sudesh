They are typically lightweight, have good strength–to–weight ratio, are cost–effective, and can be easily customized for specific projects.Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a 3D printing technology that works by melting and extruding thermoplastic filament to build up layers and create a 3D object. The filament is fed through a heated nozzle, melted, and deposited onto the build platform, where it cools and solidifies. The process is repeated layer by layer until the entire object is built. This technology is widely used for prototyping, manufacturing, and product development due to its affordability and versatility. With FDM you can produce objects with high accuracy, strength, and durability.","362692a7":"Discover the power of FDM and unleash your creativity.","5d1":"/ ","-5c8ee83":" Filament extrusion technology","443d9ea":" Dimensional tolerance – ± 0.2 mm","-5c409e71":" Max Single Print Size – 360 mm X 360 mm X 350 mm","1f12ae4c":" Dual color print","-36d4e5a":" 15 different industrial and consumer grade materials","-5b73376d":"Experience Excellence in 3D Printing","771d09fb":"Variety of Materials","1c5c47ca":"Explore a diverse selection of premium materials and colors tailored for your needs.","-1d6c18c7":"Energy Efficient Manufacturing ","3e4488d3":"FromOptimised production workflow to ecofriendly materials, we are committed to agreener future in additive Manufacturing.","-44a2c7b0":"Quick Turnaround Time","-2f293a4c":"Experience rapid delivery, turning designs into tangible realities with unmatched speed.","-61e60080":"High Precision","-2d536e3e":"Achieve unparalleled accuracy, ensuring your designs come to life with perfection.","151cb20f":"A simple, yet effective six step process","-b21d7f9":"1.
